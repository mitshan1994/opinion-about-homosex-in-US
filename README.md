## Where does this project come from?
This is the final project from the course **Inferential Statistics** conducted by Duke University on the Coursera platform.

## What does the project want to investigate?
The project focuses on if the US people's opinions about homosex have changed over years. It uses data from **General Social Survey Cumulative File** which surveys a lot of social questions.

## Which files belong to me and which files don't belong to me?
My writing is contained in the file **stat_inf_project.Rmd** which is based on the template file **template.Rmd** from the instructor of the course. And **stat_inf_project.html** and **stat_inf_project.pdf** are compiled from the source file **stat_inf_project.Rmd**. Other files are given as data files and data description from the course instructor.

## Reproducible
The whole project is reproducible if you clone the project to your disk and you have RStudio installed in your computer.
